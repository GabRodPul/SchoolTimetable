# School Timetable

Really simple application to manage and check school timetables, built with ReactJS + Express + Sequelize + MySQL.

## Backend
- Express + Sequelize + MySQL.
- Fully functioning CRUD.
- 100% TypeScript code.
- 9 fully functioning CRUDs. 

## Frontend
- WIP CRUD.
- Aesthetics inspired by other applications like Moodle.

## First Approach
-We work with one of many approaches, having our backend and frontend separated, related through calls between them., although another option would be the approach of keeping them relatively close throughout the laragon.

## Instructions üöÄ

### Prerequisites üìã

Prerequisites
- Git (for easy cloning).
- Node.js (I used v20.17.0).
- MySQL.
- A browser to visualise content.


### Installation üîß

First, clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/GabRodPul/SchoolTimetable.git
```

After that, install the backend.
```
cd SchoolTimetable
cd backend && npm install
```

And the frontend.
```

```

To start the backend, use:
